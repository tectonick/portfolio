                This page is developed open-source, but I took the main role in UI redesign (Ubuntu console style) and most of the core features,
                such as the literal console on the page which can communicate with the space's physical infrastructure through my API
                (open door status, people present inside, etc.),
                the framework for easter eggs and achievements, which is used by the community just for the fun of coding.

                This page also can communicate through the console with my <u>telegram bot</u>, written specifically for this community
                to make typical interactions (opening the door, checking who is inside, donations, monitoring funds, birthdays, 3d printer statuses, CCTV, and more)
                easier for its members.
